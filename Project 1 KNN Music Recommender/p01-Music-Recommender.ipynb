    "Spotify analyzes every track to extract a rich set of features. Understanding these is key to building an effective model. According to the [official Spotify Web API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features), these features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perceptual Features** (How music sounds to humans):\n",
    "- **`energy`** (0-1): Perceptual intensity and activity. Death metal has high energy; a Bach prelude has low energy.\n",
    "- **`valence`** (0-1): Musical positiveness. Happy, cheerful songs score high; sad, angry songs score low.\n",
    "- **`danceability`** (0-1): How suitable a track is for dancing, based on a combination of tempo, rhythm stability, and beat strength.\n",
    "- **`acousticness`** (0-1): A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Features** (Musical properties):\n",
    "- **`tempo`**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).\n",
    "- **`loudness`**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB), averaged across the track.\n",
    "- **`key`**: The estimated key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation (e.g., 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on).\n",
    "- **`mode`**: Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Features** (What's in the music):\n",
    "- **`speechiness`** (0-1): Detects the presence of spoken words. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music.\n",
    "- **`instrumentalness`** (0-1): Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track is instrumental.\n",
    "- **`liveness`** (0-1): Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live."

    "\n",
    "A crucial step in any real-world ML project is to perform a thorough data quality analysis. We need to check the **distributions**, **scales**, and **outliers** for each feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distribution**: Describes how the values of a feature are spread out. Are they symmetric (like a bell curve), or are they skewed to one side?\n",
    "- **Scale**: Refers to the range of values a feature can take (e.g., 0-1 vs. 0-200).\n",
    "- **Outliers**: These are data points that are significantly different from other observations. They can be legitimate extreme values or errors in the data.\n",
    "- **Skewness**: A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined. For a unimodal distribution, negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. A value close to 0 indicates a symmetric distribution.\n",
    "  - Skewness is mathematically defined as the third standardized moment: $g_1 = E\\left[\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^3\\right]$\n",

    "### 4.2 Designing a Hybrid Distance Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7** (15 points): Real-world recommendation systems often use **hybrid** functions that combine multiple signals to better capture user intent. This is where the \"art\" of machine learning comes in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**: Design and implement a `custom_hybrid_distance` function. This is an open-ended task. Your goal is to create a function that you believe is more musically intelligent than a simple audio feature distance. You can combine audio similarity with metadata like artist, genre, or release year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas from research to get you started:\n",
    "1. **Linear Combination**: `D_hybrid = w1 * D_audio + w2 * D_artist_penalty`\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Filtering**: `if same_artist: return D_audio * 0.5 else: return D_audio`\n",
    "3. **Context-Adaptive Weights**: Create different weights for different situations (e.g., a 'workout' context might put more weight on `energy` and `tempo`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, a weighted linear combination is a great approach. You will implement your custom function, integrate it into a new `HybridKNNRecommender` class, and test its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**: Your completed `custom_hybrid_distance` function and `HybridKNNRecommender` class, and the output of the test cell comparing recommendations."

    "### 6.1 Learning Personalized Distance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern recommendation systems learn from user behavior to personalize distance metrics. Rather than using fixed weights, they adapt to individual preferences through implicit and explicit feedback. The mathematical framework for this, often called *Metric Learning*, treats distance learning as an optimization problem. Given user feedback in the form of preferred and non-preferred items (e.g., triplets like `(anchor, positive_example, negative_example)`), the system learns a transformation of the feature space (a matrix **M**) to minimize a ranking loss, such that the distance `d(anchor, positive)` is smaller than `d(anchor, negative)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in balancing personalization with exploration. Too much personalization creates filter bubbles where users only see similar content. Real-world systems address this through multi-armed bandit algorithms that balance exploiting known preferences with exploring new areas. Privacy is also paramount; federated learning and differential privacy are used to learn from user data without it ever leaving their device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Evaluation Beyond Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy is important, real-world systems optimize for multiple objectives that better reflect user satisfaction and business goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diversity**: Measures the variety within a recommendation list, often calculated as the average pairwise distance between recommended items. The challenge is balancing diversity with relevance.\n",
    "- **Novelty & Serendipity**: Novelty measures how new recommendations are (often approximated by inverse item popularity). Serendipity measures how surprisingly relevant they are. These are crucial for long-term engagement.\n",
    "- **Coverage**: Examines what fraction of the item catalog gets recommended. Low coverage means the system only recommends popular items, creating a \"rich get richer\" effect that's unfair to new artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics often conflict. Optimizing for accuracy might reduce diversity. Production systems use multi-objective optimization techniques, often validated through extensive A/B testing that measures long-term user engagement and retention.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built a music recommendation system from the ground up, moving from fundamental data analysis to advanced, production-oriented concepts. You've implemented and tested the k-NN algorithm, designed custom similarity metrics, analyzed computational complexity, and planned for real-world deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques you've learned here—data exploration, feature engineering, model implementation, performance analysis, and system design—are the core building blocks of applied machine learning. Whether you're building recommendation systems for e-commerce, content platforms, or social networks, these principles remain the same: understand your data deeply, design thoughtful models, validate rigorously, and engineer for a larger application context.\n",
