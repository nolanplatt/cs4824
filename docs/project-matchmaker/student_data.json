The system will not only read the reports, but also pre-analyze the financial numbers and the key items in the reports. It would then recommend companies, more focused, to investigate further. The goal is to save time and energy in the research process. It would not make a decision for a person, but if the list were small enough, they could hope to discover some good opportunistic investments."
